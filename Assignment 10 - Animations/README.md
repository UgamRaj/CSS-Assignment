Learning new properties form this assignment.<br/>
1. `transform-origin` : The transform-origin property allows you to change the position of transformed elements. 2D transformations can change the x- and y-axis of an element. 3D transformations can also change the z-axis of an element.<br/>
2. `transform` : The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element.<br/>
3. The `perspective()` CSS function defines a transformation that sets the distance between the user and the z=0 plane, the perspective from which the viewer would be if the 2-dimensional interface were 3-dimensional.<br/>
4. `webkit-box-reflect` : The box-reflect property is used to create a reflection of an element.
