HTML tags are `<div>`, `<img>`, `<button>`.<br/>
Here basic idea of making this grid structure are : screen are divided into 16 columns and 6 rows.<br/>
Columns are divided 6.25% of screen width and rows are divided into 6 rem of height of 36 rem.<br/>
In first row the buttons are divided with CSS properties `display: grid`, and columns divided into 5 column and `column-gap: 10.5rem` and margin-left and margin-right in width of 60% provided then `justify-content: space-between` and `align-items: center`.<br/>
After that all the images are places at their respective position with using CSS properties `grid-area`, `grid-column`, `grid-row`.<br/>
Another CSS Properties `background-color`, `border`, `border-radius`, `margin`, `padding`.
